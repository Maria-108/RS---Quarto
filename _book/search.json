    "text": "Introduction\nHello, I’m Maria! I was born and raised in West London. I graduated in BA Geography with Spatial Data Science Pathway in July 2023 from King’s College London, and moved straight onto my masters course in Urban Spatial Science MSc at UCL (University College London) at the Center for Advance Spatial Analytics. My academic interests have always lied in human geography, especially analysing behaviour patterns, influences and place interactions. This is particularly reflected through my dissertation where I studied how the interaction and exposure from social media platforms influence the ways in which places are explored. During my undergraduate degree, I took three modules in spatial data science, where we focused on learning the Python programming language, and this later encouraged me to continue this pathway and expand my technical skills.\nAside from academic interests, I have always loved to travel and explore places ever since I can remember, which is partially what inspired me to take geography in the first place. Alongside that, my dance trips have enabled me to visit different countries and cultures, enjoy good food, music and warm weather.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it is not my first time coding, Remote Sensing is a relatively new topic for me, as it is not usually taken by human geographers. I am keen to learn about how these skills are applied in spatial analysis, and hopefully I can implement what I have learnt in the future!"

    "section": "1.1 Summary",
    "text": "1.1 Summary\nThe concept of remote sensing is as clear as the name suggests; it is “sensing” ie: observing certain features of the Earth from a distance, often conducted through the aid of satellites. By exact definition it is: “the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance” (USGS 2024).\nSpatial data scientists, among many other analysts, are taught to use this data which enables them to conduct analysis and gain geographical insight of a particular study area. This can involve topology, weather conditions, density of buildings, how developed an area is, and many more.\n\n1.1.1 Passive vs. Active Satellites\n\nThere are two types of satellites that have been designed for Earth Observation known to Remote Sensing. The diagrams illustrate the differences between the functions of these satellite types. Passive satellite sensors are designed to reflect energy from the Sun, where its’ energy is distributed and sensed as electromagnetic waves.\nExamples of passive sensors include the following:\n\nLandsat 8\nSentiel-2\nAqua (MODIS)\nPlanetscope (Dove)\nWorldview-4\nPleiades\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive satellite sensors are designed to emit electromagnetic waves which then waits to receive information. These particular sensors are able to “see through” clouds, volcanic ash and other atmospheric conditions, and are also able to collect data during the night.\nExamples of active sensors include the following:\n\nSAR (Synthetic Apeture Radar)\nLiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)\nSentiel-1\nRADARSAT-2\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) - Waves\nElectromagnetic waves are three-dimensional in terms of the vertical movement of the electric field (blue), the horizontal movement of the magnetic field (pink) across a particular direction (as shown in the diagram below). These wavelengths come in different sizes creating an electromagnetic spectrum which can indicate the type of radiation emitted towards the Earth. Passive satellite sensors tend to operate in the visible, infrared, thermal infrared and microwave sections of the electromagnetic spectrum (NASA 2024), whilst active sensors operate on microwave and radio wavelength sections (ESA 2024).\n\nImage Source: created through Canva\n\n\n1.1.3 Atmospheric Scattering\nThe energy emitted from the Sun is scattered into the atmosphere as particles. The smaller wavelengths scatter across the Earth’s atmosphere, and are often captured by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Resolutions\nThere are four types of resolutions that need to be considered in remote sensing. One of the more obvious ones relate to spatial resolution which determines the size of each pixel in an image. In this way, you are selecting the geographic scale of the satellite image where lower range of meters implies a high-resolution image, as it is recorded from the closest capturing point (zoom level) to Earth observation, whilst the higher kilometer range indicated a lower-resolution image.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other three definitions have been provided by NASA Earthdata (2024)\nSpectral - “the ability of a sensor to discern finer wavelengths”. This implies the resolution should have more or narrower bands.\nTemporal - “the time it take for a satellite to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation data”.\nRadiometric - “the amount of information in each pixel…the no. of bits representing the energy recorded”."

    "text": "1.2 Applications\n\nImage source: Viasat (2024)\nThe image above illustrates how different types of devices and technologies can operate on different wavelength frequencies, and thus correspond to a certain Hertz range. Satellites are able to capture different wavelengths, and this is determined on which bands are used for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Viasat (2024)\nAccording to Patino & Duque (2013), the applications of remote sensing have advanced to benefit urban planning, as it can be implemented in research that involves the following: population density estimation, house-value modelling, informal settlement detection, land surface temperature, vegetation cover, soil quality detection etc, all of which can cause additional social impacts due to its relation to the urban environment. Much of this data obtained can be integrated into both local and national policies, which contribute to the urban development of a given area.\nZhao et al. (2019) reviewed nighttime light observation, which is enabled through observing active satellite sensors. Their study looked at the DMSP-OLS satellite (Defence Meteorological Satellite Programme - Operational Linescan System) where the photomultiplier tube (PMT) is used for detecting cities, fires, fishing boats and moonlit clouds. According to the NCEI (National Centre for Environmental Information), this type of satellite uses “visible and infrared sensors that collect images globally across a 3000km swath, twice a day”. This data also provides both solar and lunar information, which enables nighttime observations to be recorded according to the time period of intended detection. Despite the obvious benefit of this satellite being able to account for nighttime records, one of the drawback on this data is the “percent frequency of cloud-free light detections with no brightness information”. Zhao et al. (2019) have argued that this factor complicates the research of human activities during nighttime detection."

(Nadir = view of directly looking down on an area)\nTopography -\nWind -\nRotation of the earth -\n\nAdditionally ground control points (GCPs) need to be identified in order to match points to the satellite image.

    "section": "4.1 Summary",
    "text": "4.1 Summary\nFor this week’s task, I chose to look into Sydney’s Green Roof & Wall policy that was first introduced in 2014. The City of Sydney has already implemented this policy a decade ago, but has undergone slow progress which recorded 98,000m2 of green roofs and walls installed in March 2014, but currently this only equates to less than 1% of available roof space across the city. The local council set out a criteria that demands a minimum 30% vegetation cover to be installed in order to be considered as a “green roof”. 18% of Sydney’s central business district has potential to be retrofitted to accommodate the green roof policy.\n\nImage source: City of Sydney (2024)\nThere are several benefits that are generated through the implementation of the green roof policy:\n\nAir quality - an increase in vegetation helps remove any harmful pollutants that may circulate the air.\nBiodiversity - can attract and support habitats of local fauna and flora\nInsulation - the multi-layering of different components that compose a green roof help to “reduce the reliance on active heating and cooling, which helps reduce energy consumption”.\nNoise - similar to the previous point, the layering and insulation provide and additional benefit of sound insulation, which reduce potential noise pollution from the surrounding active urban environment\nSpace - “previously unused space can be turned into valuable space for recreation, gardening, growing food etc”.\nRoof life - according to the local council, upgrading a roof through this strategy can extend a roof’s lifespan by up to 40 years. This is due to the fact that the extensive layering of a roof (as seen in the right-hand image above) limits the exposure to the Sun and harsh climate conditions.\nUrban heat island effect - green roofs help to combat this as the vegetative layer is known to reduce surface air temperatures."

    "text": "4.2 Applications\nThere are several ways in which remote sensing can be implemented into Sydney’s Green Roof Policy:\n\nMeasuring roof space - this can be done through using SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data, which can detect the housing footprints, as it extracts polygon data to obtain the square footage of each building that has the potential to install a green roof. These measurements can be compared to construction data to ensure the measurements recorded align with the extracted data from the satellite.\nDetecting vegetation - the NDVI data can be extracted which will be able to detect the vegetation from existing buildings with implemented green roofs. Given that a minimum of 30% vegetation cover is required to meet the criteria from the city council, this can be paired up with roof measurements to detect which buildings are compatible with these requirements.\nTime-scale comparison - according to NASA Landsat Science (2024), GISS analysts used Landsat data to study how green roofs impacted temperature change in Chicago. Similarly, Sydney can use this data to present and compare before and after installing green roofs, and how increasing the scale of green roofs over time influence (ideally to reduce) temperatures, thus combating the urban heat island effect.\nTemperature change - Li et al. (2022) argues that this can be detected through several satellites such as Terra, Aqua and many more. LST (land surface temperature) can be measured and compared to a before and after period to test the extent of influence green roof implementation has on reducing temperatures."
