# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Hello, I'm Maria! I was born and raised in West London. I graduated in BA Geography with Spatial Data Science Pathway in July 2023 from King's College London, and moved straight onto my masters course in Urban Spatial Science MSc at UCL (University College London) at the Center for Advance Spatial Analytics. My academic interests have always lied in human geography, especially analysing behaviour patterns, influences and place interactions. This is particularly reflected through my dissertation where I studied how the interaction and exposure from social media platforms influence the ways in which places are explored. During my undergraduate degree, I took three modules in spatial data science, where we focused on learning the Python programming language, and this later encouraged me to continue this pathway and expand my technical skills.

Aside from academic interests, I have always loved to travel and explore places ever since I can remember, which is partially what inspired me to take geography in the first place. Alongside that, my dance trips have enabled me to visit different countries and cultures, enjoy good food, music and warm weather.

Although it is not my first time coding, Remote Sensing is a relatively new topic for me, as it is not usually taken by human geographers. I am keen to learn about how these skills are applied in spatial analysis, and hopefully I can implement what I have learnt in the future!
