    "text": "Introduction\nHello, I’m Maria! I was born and raised in West London. I graduated in BA Geography with Spatial Data Science Pathway in July 2023 from King’s College London, and moved straight onto my masters course in Urban Spatial Science MSc at UCL (University College London) at the Center for Advance Spatial Analytics. My academic interests have always lied in human geography, especially analysing behaviour patterns, influences and place interactions. This is particularly reflected through my dissertation where I studied how the interaction and exposure from social media platforms influence the ways in which places are explored. During my undergraduate degree, I took three modules in spatial data science, where we focused on learning the Python programming language, and this later encouraged me to continue this pathway and expand my technical skills.\nAside from academic interests, I have always loved to travel and explore places ever since I can remember, which is partially what inspired me to take geography in the first place. Alongside that, my dance trips have enabled me to visit different countries and cultures, enjoy good food, music and warm weather.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it is not my first time coding, Remote Sensing is a relatively new topic for me, as it is not usually taken by human geographers. I am keen to learn about how these skills are applied in spatial analysis, and hopefully I can implement what I have learnt in the future!"

    "section": "1.1 Summary",
    "text": "1.1 Summary\nThe concept of remote sensing is as clear as the name suggests; it is “sensing” ie: observing certain features of the Earth from a distance, often conducted through the aid of satellites. By exact definition it is: “the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance” (USGS 2024).\nSpatial data scientists, among many other analysts, are taught to use this data which enables them to conduct analysis and gain geographical insight of a particular study area. This can involve topology, weather conditions, density of buildings, how developed an area is, and many more.\n\n1.1.1 Passive vs. Active Satellites\n\nThere are two types of satellites that have been designed for Earth Observation known to Remote Sensing. The diagrams illustrate the differences between the functions of these satellite types. Passive satellite sensors are designed to reflect energy from the Sun, where its’ energy is distributed and sensed as electromagnetic waves.\nExamples of passive sensors include the following:\n\nLandsat 8\nSentiel-2\nAqua (MODIS)\nPlanetscope (Dove)\nWorldview-4\nPleiades\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive satellite sensors are designed to emit electromagnetic waves which then waits to receive information. These particular sensors are able to “see through” clouds, volcanic ash and other atmospheric conditions, and are also able to collect data during the night.\nExamples of active sensors include the following:\n\nSAR (Synthetic Apeture Radar)\nLiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)\nSentiel-1\nRADARSAT-2\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) - Waves\nElectromagnetic waves are three-dimensional in terms of the vertical movement of the electric field (blue), the horizontal movement of the magnetic field (pink) across a particular direction (as shown in the diagram below). These wavelengths come in different sizes creating an electromagnetic spectrum which can indicate the type of radiation emitted towards the Earth. Passive satellite sensors tend to operate in the visible, infrared, thermal infrared and microwave sections of the electromagnetic spectrum (NASA 2024), whilst active sensors operate on microwave and radio wavelength sections (ESA 2024).\n\nImage Source: created through Canva\n\n\n1.1.3 Atmospheric Scattering\nThe energy emitted from the Sun is scattered into the atmosphere as particles. The smaller wavelengths scatter across the Earth’s atmosphere, whilst longer wavelengths are absorbed and reflected back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Resolutions\nThere are four types of resolutions that need to be considered in remote sensing. One of the more obvious ones relate to spatial resolution which determines the size of each pixel in an image. In this way, you are selecting the geographic scale of the satellite image where lower range of meters implies a high-resolution image, as it is recorded from the closest capturing point (zoom level) to Earth observation, whilst the higher kilometer range indicated a lower-resolution image.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other three definitions have been provided by NASA Earthdata (2024)\nSpectral - “the ability of a sensor to discern finer wavelengths”. This implies the resolution should have more or narrower bands.\nTemporal - “the time it take for a satellite to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation data”.\nRadiometric - “the amount of information in each pixel…the no. of bits representing the energy recorded”."

Satellites are able to capture different wavelengths, and this is determined on which bands are used for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Viasat (2024)\nAccording to Patino & Duque (2013), the applications of remote sensing have advanced to benefit urban planning, as it can be implemented in research that involves the following: population density estimation, house-value modelling, informal settlement detection, land surface temperature, vegetation cover, soil quality detection etc, all of which can cause additional social impacts due to its relation to the urban environment. Much of this data obtained can be integrated into both local and national policies, which contribute to the urban development of a given area.\nZhao et al. (2019) reviewed nighttime light observation, which is enabled through observing active satellite sensors. Their study looked at the DMSP-OLS satellite (Defence Meteorological Satellite Programme - Operational Linescan System) where the photomultiplier tube (PMT) is used for detecting cities, fires, fishing boats and moonlit clouds. According to the NCEI (National Centre for Environmental Information), this type of satellite uses “visible and infrared sensors that collect images globally across a 3000km swath, twice a day”. This data also provides both solar and lunar information, which enables nighttime observations to be recorded according to the time period of intended detection. Despite the obvious benefit of this satellite being able to account for nighttime records, one of the drawback on this data is the “percent frequency of cloud-free light detections with no brightness information”. Zhao et al. (2019) have argued that this factor complicates the research of human activities during nighttime detection."

I particularly enjoyed learning about the different types of sensors that operate on satellites, and the difference in types of resolution available to view and how this can alter the perspective of the area observed. I wasn’t aware of the amount of components that are require for remote sensing, despite the assumption of the complexity of satellites. I was particularly interested in discovering the applications of active sensors, as they can detect during the night and through clouds, which opens up a lot of research opportunities. I was interested in learning the different types of resolutions that are taken into account when processing satellite images.\nBased on the concepts introduced above, this made me realise that remote sensing can be a useful tool in spatial analysis as there are many features that can be used and adjusted such as the resolution type and scale that alter the way in which certain areas and geographical characteristics can be analysed. I don’t know yet whether I will be implementing remote sensing in my work in the future, but if in any case I do, I’m sure it would add an insightful perspective to my analysis which is equally visually stimulating."

    "title": "3  Week 3 - Corrections",
    "section": "3.1 Summary",
    "text": "3.1 Summary\nThis week focuses on corrections in remote sensing, often referring to the process which is applied to the raw satellite image. There are three types of corrections that can be used in remote sensing, and each poses a different solution to the type of image distortion encountered.\n\n3.1.1 Geometric correction\nThere are different types of errors that can occur when satellite data is being collected. In the case of this error, image distortions are at the forefront. For this type of correction, there are four potential image distortions that can be encountered: view angle, topography, wind and rotation of the Earth.\nIn order for this process to work, ground control points (GCPs) need to be identified in order to match points to the satellite image. Here the coordinates are modelled to produce geometric transformation coefficients. This is then plotted and we set the value to 0.5 in order to minimise the root-mean-square-deviation (RMSE).\nThere is another solution that can be applied for geometric correction. This involves the following calculation: (observed - predicted ((the residual))^2. Here the results will be summed up and divided by the no. of data points, and additionally, you calculate the square root of that result.\nThe image below illustrates how this process works.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: AWF Wiki (2024)\nThis indicates that the image may be re-sampled as a result. The following list provides ways in which re-sampling can be applied:\n\nLinear\nCubic\nCubic Spline\nNearest Neighbour\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Atmospheric correction\nAccording to GIS Geography (2023), atmospheric correction is the process which “removes the scattering and absorption effects from the atmosphere”. There are three types of atmospheric correction that can be applied:\n\nRelative (to something) correction aims to normalise the intensities of bands within a single image and from multiple dates to one. This can be achieved through the following processes:\n\nDark Object Subtraction (DOS) that searches for the darkest value in each band and subtracts it from each pixel.\nPseudo-Invariant Features (PIFs) that “assumes brightness pixels” of a base image and adjusts it according to the regression result.\n\nAbsolute (definitive) correction aims to change the brightness values into “scaled surface reflectance”, which is later compared to the surface reflectance. However, some datasets may require image altitude and atmospheric visibility data in order for this correction to be properly applied.\nEmpirical Line Correction which uses the measurements that derived form the linear regression against the satellite data. This involves the following calculation: Reflectance (fieldspectrum) = gain * radiance(input data) + offset\n\nThe image below shows the difference between satellite images before (left image - which shows “top of atmosphere reflectance”) and after (right image - which shows “surface reflectance”) atmospheric correction is applied. Often, “absorption and scattering creates haze in an image, which reduces the contrast of the image” (Lecture 3, slide 27) and this can be seen across the two images below.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Mapbox (2013)\n\n\n3.1.3 Topographic correction\nThis type of correction is also know as Orthorectification Correction which is a subset of georectification. It is the process where distortions are removed through setting the viewpoint to the nadir, and in addition to that it provides coordinates to the image. This error occurs as “The topographical variations in the surface of the earth and the tilt of the satellite or aerial sensor can affect the distance with which features on the satellite or aerial image are displayed.” (Satellite Imaging Corporation (2022). The image below shows the layers applied when performing this correcton, which inidicates the requirement of an elevation model. Additionally this solution requires the cosine correction\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Intermap (2019)\n\n\n3.1.4 Radiometric calibration\n\n\n3.1.5 Definitions\nAzimuth angle - “the compass direction from which the sunlight is coming” that informs you which direction to face and can vary from 0˚ to 360˚\nGeorectification - giving coordinates to an image\nNadir - view of directly looking down on an area\nOrthorectification - removing distortions by making the pixels viewpoint at the nadir\nScattering - can create the “adjacency effect”, radiance from pixels nearby mixed into pixel of interest\nSlope - attenuated atmospheric correction which involved the “dimming and blurring from scattering of light”. This is the electromagnetic wave absorption and scattering by the atmosphere.\nSolar azimuth - compass angle of the Sun (N=0˚) 90˚E at sunrise and 270˚W at sunset\nSolar zenith - angle of local zenith (above the point on ground) and Sun from vertical (90˚ elevation)\nView angle - this means that the image angle doesn’t align with the Nadir."

    "title": "4  Week 4 - Policy",
    "section": "4.1 Summary",
    "text": "4.1 Summary\nFor this week’s task, I chose to look into Sydney’s Green Roof & Wall policy that was first introduced in 2014. The City of Sydney has already implemented this policy a decade ago, but has undergone slow progress which recorded 98,000m2 of green roofs and walls installed in March 2014, but currently this only equates to less than 1% of available roof space across the city (see bottom left image below). The local council set out a criteria that demands a minimum 30% vegetation cover to be installed in order to be considered as a “green roof”. 18% of Sydney’s central business district has potential to be retrofitted to accommodate the green roof policy.\n\n\nImage source of top two and bottom left photo: City of Sydney (2024)\nImage source of bottom right graph: Williams et al. (2021)\nThe bottom right image is taken from Williams et al. (2021) study which shows what types of buildings have implemented green roofs in Melbourne. When you compare this to the types of buildings listed to have either implemented a green roof or a green wall by the City of Sydney (bottom right image), it can assumed that Sydney also prioritised commercial buildings (in this case hotels), residential apartments and buildings such as 1 Bligh Street which is located in the central business district.\nThere are several benefits that are generated through the implementation of the green roof policy:\n\nAir quality - an increase in vegetation helps remove any harmful pollutants that may circulate the air.\nBiodiversity - can attract and support habitats of local fauna and flora\nInsulation - the multi-layering of different components that compose a green roof help to “reduce the reliance on active heating and cooling, which helps reduce energy consumption”.\nNoise - similar to the previous point, the layering and insulation provide and additional benefit of sound insulation, which reduce potential noise pollution from the surrounding active urban environment\nSpace - “previously unused space can be turned into valuable space for recreation, gardening, growing food etc”.\nRoof life - according to the local council, upgrading a roof through this strategy can extend a roof’s lifespan by up to 40 years. This is due to the fact that the extensive layering of a roof (as seen in the right-hand image above) limits the exposure to the Sun and harsh climate conditions.\nUrban heat island effect - green roofs help to combat this as the vegetative layer is known to reduce surface air temperatures."

    "section": "4.2 Applications",
    "text": "4.2 Applications\nThere are several ways in which remote sensing can be implemented into Sydney’s Green Roof Policy. Although this policy was already implemented in 2014, it can be argued that there is scope to extend the project through detecting how many buildings can upgrade to a green roof, along side accommodating for the existing 18% of potential buildings that were detected prior to this. Additionally, the effects of green roofs on temperature reduction can be further studied by researcher when a significant amount of green roofs have been implemented in accordance to their policy aims towards a greener and sustainable city.\n\nMeasuring roof space - this can be done through using SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data, which can detect the housing footprints, as it extracts polygon data to obtain the square footage of each building that has the potential to install a green roof. These measurements can be compared to construction data to ensure the measurements recorded align with the extracted data from the satellite. Additionally, Bartesaghi-Koc et al. (2020) state that “LiDAR can be used to detect building footprints”.\nDetecting vegetation - the NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) data can be extracted which will be able to detect the vegetation from existing buildings with implemented green roofs. Given that a minimum of 30% vegetation cover is required to meet the criteria from the city council, this can be paired up with roof measurements to detect which buildings are compatible with these requirements.\nTime-scale comparison - according to NASA Landsat Science (2024), GISS analysts used Landsat data to study how green roofs impacted temperature change in Chicago. Similarly, Sydney can use this data to present and compare before and after installing green roofs, and how increasing the scale of green roofs over time influence (ideally to reduce) temperatures, thus combating the urban heat island effect.\nTemperature change - Li et al. (2022) argues that this can be detected through several satellites such as Terra, Aqua and many more. LST (land surface temperature) can be measured and compared to a before and after period to test the extent of influence green roof implementation has on reducing temperatures. Additionally, Bartesaghi-Koc et al. (2020) conducted a study where they assessed NDVI data from summer and winter recordings using “Visible (RED) and Near Infrared (NIR) reflectance bands” to gain insight on whether compare tree cover results in cooling the temperature. Perhaps the same methods can be applied to detect the increase of vegetation and its impact on cooling the air temperature in order to reduce the urban heat island effect in Sydney."

    "text": "4.3 Reflections\nIn researching Sydney’s policy it was surprising to see how only less than 1% (53 buildings) have implemented green roofs to abide with the city’s policy. Although the policy does not directly state particular requirements in terms of quantity or building types that must adopt the policy, rather it states the benefits of implementing such green roofs and walls, it is still relatively shocking to see how little progress has been made, given that it has been a decade since its original installation. Perhaps there are several limitations to installing green roofs that may not be explicitly stated such as the cost of installation, availability of roofs and existing quality of roofs that may determine whether or not the buildings’ roof can sustain such upgrades.\nGiven that remote sensing enables the ease of detecting physical features within the environment, it was interesting to see how satellite data can be used for urban purposes. The policy promotes a solution whose main focus is designed towards tackling the urban heat island effect, but also produces social benefits such as generating usable space, reducing noise, and creating aesthetically appealing buildings which creates attraction towards a place. Although remote sensing cannot measure these social additions, it was interesting to see how it can measure the physical features such as vegetation, building footprints and air temperature to assess to what extent does implementing such policies create a positive environmental impacts, that would bring Sydney closer to achieving their sustainability goals."
